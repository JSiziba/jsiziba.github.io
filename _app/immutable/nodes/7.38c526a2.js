However, obtaining and renewing SSL certificates can be costly and time-consuming, especially for small projects or personal websites. That’s why I decided to use Certbot, a free and open-source tool that automates the process of obtaining and renewing SSL certificates from Let’s Encrypt, a non-profit certificate authority that provides free SSL certificates for anyone who owns a domain name.</p> <p>In this article, I will share with you how I used Certbot to get a free SSL certificate for my Spring Boot web application, and how I configured it to work with my server. I will also show you how I solved some of the challenges that I faced along the way.</p>",Z,u,x,_e="Step 1: Install Certbot",ee,H,be="The first step is to install Certbot on your server.

There are different ways to do this, depending on how you want to verify your domain ownership and how you want to configure your web server.

To use this mode, you need to run the following command:",ae,T,re,B,Pe="This command will prompt you to provide some information, such as your email address and your domain name. You need to have a valid domain name that points to your server’s IP address. If you don’t have one, you can use a free dynamic DNS service, such as [No-IP], to create one. I used No-IP to create a subdomain for my server and updated the DNS records accordingly.",ie,z,Ie="After you provide the necessary information, Certbot will attempt to bind to port 80 on your server and complete the verification process.

Therefore, we need to convert the PEM files to a PKCS12 file using the openssl command. To do this, you need to go to the /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain directory and run the following command:",de,$,ue,O,Be="This command will create a PKCS12 file named springboot_letsencrypt.p12 that contains the certificate, the private key, and the certificate chain.
